This was the last project that I was working on at McLean. They decided to go in a different diretion so this was never put into production, thus I kept the code. Maplayers2 is still used by the company so the code will not be found in my Git repository. 
I was about %50 done with this project.
We were moving from openlayers to leaflet, node.js instead of PHP, JSON db field type in PostGreSQL instead of MySQL for configurations. This was much faster and much less code then Maplayers 2. I deeply regret not getting to finsih this project.
